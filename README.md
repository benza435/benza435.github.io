# Privacy
As Google have decided I must have a privacy policy, and I don't know that really is, I've knocked together a quick list of things.  
I'm a solo developer, with no interest in data collection.  I just want to try publishing an app.  

1. I do not know who you are, or anything about you.
2. I will not seek to store any information about you.
3. Google will probably collect some of your information, but you'll have to check with them about that.
4. This app does not communicate ANYTHING back to me whatsoever.  At all.
5. I really don't like the current data harvesting culture we are all subject to.
6. If you email me, I will keep that email for as long as it takes me to respond to it, and then probably some time after that.  I will not share that information with anybody else.
7. Let's just be reasonable about this.  Download the app and use it if you like.  I won't even know if you are using it.
8. If you have read this far, you are probably suffering some form of procrastination habit.  Go and do something useful!
